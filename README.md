1. Create an HTML form

Design a form with input fields such as name, email, password, etc.

Add a submit button to send the form data.



2. Identify the fields that need validation

For example:

Name → should not be empty

Email → must contain “@” and a valid domain

Password → must be at least 8 characters

Confirm Password → should match the password




3. Write validation rules in JavaScript

Use JavaScript to check each field before the form is submitted.

If a rule is broken, stop the submission and show an error message.



4. Attach validation function to form events

Use the form’s onsubmit event to call the validation function when the user clicks "Submit".

Optionally, use onblur or oninput to validate fields as the user types.



5. Display error messages

Show short, clear messages near each input box (e.g., “Please enter a valid email address”).

Use red color or warning symbols for better visibility.



6. Prevent form submission if errors exist

If any field is invalid, prevent the form from being sent to the server.

Use return false in your JavaScript validation function.



7. Show success message

If all fields are valid, allow the form to submit and optionally display a “Form submitted successfully” message.



8. Test validation

Try different inputs (empty fields, wrong email, short password, etc.) to make sure validation works properly.
